Hi! I am Maxwell Smith, a full stack engineer. I have been working in industry now for about 2 years after graduating from BYU in computer science. I am accustomed to fast paced development, and the sell-design-build model for software development.

I have had the opportunity to act as technical founder for several high impact products which quickly gained traction and made real revenue at the companies I have worked for. In my current role, around 5mil in revenue can be attributed directly to products I architected and built alone. I am quick to bring ideas to market, since I believe that the best way to make a sustainable business is by building what the customer will buy.

I enjoy making products that have real impact for those who use them, and I have a personal objective to change the world through software. As the world changes with AI at the forefront, I want to be right there exploring the next frontier of software business.
